Getting Started
---------------

To build Purified from source, you'll need to be familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).


To initialize your local repository, use this command:

	repo init -u https://github.com/PurifiedRom/manifest.git -b lp

Then to sync source, use this command:

	repo sync
	
After syncing is done, use these commands to build:

	1.) . build/envsetup.sh
	2.) lunch
	3.) Pick Device
	4.) make bacon -j8
